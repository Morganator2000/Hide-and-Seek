The microbit code does not always copy correctly using the drag-and drop method.
Here's what you do in those situations.

Windows:
1. Open the command prompt.
2. Navigate to the download folder.
    ex: cd /Users/username/Downloads
3. Run this command, using the name of your hex file.
    robocopy /z . D:\ file-name.hex

So far this method has not failed me.
This command can maybe be used to copy the hex files from the app.
