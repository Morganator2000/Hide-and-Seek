Welcome to micro:bit hide-and-seek quick-start guide:

1. Double-click HideAndSeek.exe
2. Enter the number of micro:bits that will serve as "beacons" (the ones the students will search for).
3. Enter the number of micro:bits that will serve as "seekers" (the ones the students will use to find the beacons).
4. Start entering the list of clues. As many as you would like.

LOSING A Beacon:
In the event that you lose a beacon, plug in any other micro:bit and upload the "retriever" hex file to it. It will automatically call out to any lost beacons. Then it's a game of "hot and cold" to find the lost micro:bit. The more LEDs that light up, the closer you are.
