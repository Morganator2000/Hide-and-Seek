Welcome to micro:bit hide-and-seek quick-start guide:

1. Double-click index.html. It will open in your default browser. If it doesn't, right click and choose to "Open with..." and then choose something like Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc.
2. Enter the number of seeking micro:bits that will serve as "seekers" (the ones the students will use to find the beacons).
3. Enter the number of hidden micro:bits that will serve as "beacons" (the ones the students will search for).
4. Start entering the questions and their possible answers. You are allowed to include true/false questions and multiple choice questions with up to 4 options. Be sure to use the checkbox to indicate which option is the correct answer to the question.
5. Click "Submit". The required hexfiles will be send to your "Downloads" folder.
6. Plug in a micro:bit and drag-and-drop one of the hexfiles into it. Each micro:bit can only hold one hexfile at a time. If the download suceeds you'll see either "S#" or "B#" on the screen, where "#" is the number for that beacon/seeker.
7. Plug the battery boxes into the beacons. Turn them on if there is a switch on the battery box. Hide the beacons wherever you like. They should be at least 3 meters apart. While the players will not need to touch the beacons, they will need to be able to get within 1 meter of the beacons, so be careful when placing them in elevated positions.
8. Plug the power boxes into the seekers. Distribute the seekers among the players or groups of players.
9. Let the game begin!

Using the Seekers.
1. Press the button on the back of the micro:bit to turn them on and reset them. If there is a switch on the battery pack, turn that on. DO NOT turn the seeker off for the rest of the game.
2. Use the clues to track down the hidden beacons. When you are close, a [symbol] will appear on the screen.
3. Press both buttons to receive the question. It will appear on your seeker.
4. Scroll to the correct answer using the A and B buttons. Press both buttons to choose that as the correct answer.
5. You will see a checkmark if you got the question correct and an X if you got it incorrect.
6. Repeat from step 2 until you have found all the beacons. Return to your instructor when finished.
7. At any time you can shake the micro:bit to see how many questions you have answered correctly.

LOSING A Beacon:
In the event that you lose a beacon, plug in any other micro:bit and upload the "retriever" hex file to it. It will automatically call out to any lost beacons. Then it's a game of "hot and cold" to find the lost micro:bit. The more LEDs that light up, the closer you are.
